Data on COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard have been provided directly with the research compendium because the data is no longer available online in the state in which it was downloaded on August 1, 2020.
The dashboard and cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths were continually updated, so an exact reproduction required communication with the original author, Jayajit Chakraborty, for assistance with provision of data from August 1, 2020.
The data includes an estimate of the total population (`POP_ESTIMA`) and confirmed COVID-19 cases (`Confirmed`).
The COVID-19 case data expresses cumulative count of reported COVID-19 from 1/22/2020 to 8/1/2020.
Although metadata for this particular resource is no longer available from the original source, one can reasonably assume that the total population estimate was based on the 2014-2018 5-year ACS estimate, as the 2019 estimates data had not been released yet.

Versions of the data can be found at the John Hopkins CCSE COVID-19 Data Repository (<https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>).
However, archived data only provides summaries at the national scale.
We received the COVID-19 case data through 8/1/2020 at the county level from the author, as there is no readily apparent way to access archived data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science Engineering database.
